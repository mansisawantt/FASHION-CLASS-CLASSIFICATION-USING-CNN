FASHION CLASS CLASSIFICATION USING CNN

OBJECTIVE
<br/>In this case study we'll look at a hypothetical situation. We assume that if a retailer hired you to build a virtual stylist assistant that looks at customer Instagram and Facebook images and classifies what fashion category they are wearing either bags dresses and pants. The virtual assistant can help the retailer detect and forecast fashion trends and launch targeted marketing campaigns.

<br/>In this story we're going to use the fashionmnist data. It's a data set that contains images of bags shoes and dresses. And we're asking the deep network to classify the images into 10 classes.

<br/>So we wanted to build kind of an app per se or a model. They can look at images and can tell us exactly what category in this image. Is it like a short. Is it a bag. Is it like a hat. And so on.
