FASHION CLASS CLASSIFICATION USING CNN

OBJECTIVE
<br/>In this case study we'll look at a hypothetical situation. We assume that if a retailer hired you to build a virtual stylist assistant that looks at customer Instagram and Facebook images and classifies what fashion category they are wearing either bags dresses and pants. The virtual assistant can help the retailer detect and forecast fashion trends and launch targeted marketing campaigns.

<br/>In this story we're going to use the fashionmnist data. It's a data set that contains images of bags shoes and dresses. And we're asking the deep network to classify the images into 10 classes.

<br/>So we wanted to build kind of an app per se or a model. They can look at images and can tell us exactly what category in this image. Is it like a short. Is it a bag. Is it like a hat. And so on.

<br/>PROBLEMS STATEMENT AND BUSINESS CASE
<br/>Fashion training set consist of 70,000 images divided into 60,000 training and 10,000 testing samples. Dataset samples consits of 28x28 grayscale image associated with a label from 10 calsses

<br/>The top 10 callases as follows :

<br/>0 -> T-shirts
<br/>1 -> Trouser
<br/>2 -> Pullover
<br/>3 -> Dress
<br/>4 -> Coat
<br/>5 -> Sandel
<br/>6 -> Shirt
<br/>7 -> Sneaker
<br/>8 -> Bag
<br/>9 -> Ankle boot

<br/>Each Image is 28 pixel in hight and 28 pixel in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single Pixel value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of the pixel. Higher number means darker piexl. The pixel value is an integer Between 0 and 255
